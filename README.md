# ToyProj
This project is just to play around with some simple JavaScript, and is shown on the [Web Page](https://zafrem.github.io/ToyProj/).

I'm going to write a simple web application and leave something useful here.

## [Mathematics](./Mathematics/README.md)
My kid is doing a worksheet for math training and I thought it would be simple enough to make.

If you want to re-solve the wrong problems, you need to create a DB in firebase. It's not fun to write... It should be fun...

## [Timer](./Timer/README.md)
This is a timer feature that I don't think is necessary. I created it because I needed a cycle to rest and restart when exercising more than anything else.

## [Game](./Game/README.md)
I'm trying to make a simple game, but I'm having a hard time: idea, design, sound, etc... I think the people who make games for sale are amazing.

## [D-Day](./D-Day/README.md)
I'm trying to make it from a personal D-Day view to a historical or archival view, but the DB is hard to get. I'm trying to think of a way to make a DB.

## [Todo](./To-do/README.md)
This was the first site I ever created. It's the most basic feature of any scheduling program.

But I keep getting charged for internet sharing, so I created it and use it.

## [Whiteboard](./Whiteboard/README.md)
It's not a special feature, but there are times when I need the board, so I made it simple to create and save.
