# Mathematics

This app is focused on improving skills in computation and math through repetitive training.

Right now, I'm building the basic framework. I'm creating levels for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

I think I need to add some fun in the future. I have two ways to do it, but I'm not sure which way to do it.

## Request
1. Repeat the exercise and check time to see where fall short.
2. Understand the underlying principles.
3. 

## Orientation of the application

> Case 1. Keep the math, but add external factors. - Scores, rankings, rewards, etc...
 
> Case 2. Add fun elements to the calculation itself. - Graphics, different orientations

For now, I'll go with Case 1. It's not that I lack design skills, maybe....
